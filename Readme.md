`XamarinLocalization` is Xamarin application that uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices to localize its position. This project was developed as a major qualifying project for a university degree. Currently it has three implemented algorithms for localization and two averaging mechanisms for dealing with stray recieved signal strength (RSSI) values. 

> Note: Currently only supports Android 6.0+, in the works of adding iOS, Mac, and UWP.
