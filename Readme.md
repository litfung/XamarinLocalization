# XamarinLocalization   [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/rust-lang/rust.svg)]() [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license)

`XamarinLocalization` is Xamarin application that uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices to localize its position. This project was developed as a major qualifying project for a university degree. Currently it has three implemented algorithms for localization and two averaging mechanisms for dealing with stray recieved signal strength (RSSI) values. 

> Note: This is a WIP. Currently only supports Android 6.0+, in the works of adding iOS, Mac, and UWP.
