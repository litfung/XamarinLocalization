# XamarinLocalization   [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/badges/shields.svg)](https://github.com/DogFive/XamarinLocalization/issues) [![license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mashape/apistatus.svg)]()

`XamarinLocalization` is Xamarin application that uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices to localize its position. This project was developed as a major qualifying project for a university degree. Currently it has three implemented algorithms for localization and two averaging mechanisms for dealing with stray recieved signal strength (RSSI) values. 

> Note: This is a WIP. Currently only supports Android 6.0+, in the works of adding iOS, Mac, and UWP.

### Usage

	1. Build Solution
	2. Set BLELocalization-android as Startup Project
	3. Deploy to device
	4. Go to Settings > Apps > BLELocalization and allow permissions for Location
